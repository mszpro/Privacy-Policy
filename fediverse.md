# Privacy Policy for SoraSNS and other Fediverse apps

Effective Date: 2024-04-20

Thank you for choosing to use SoraSNS. At SoraSNS, we recognize the importance of your privacy. This policy is designed to inform you about the data we collect, how we use it, and your choices related to that data.

## Home Server Data

Your post data, liked post data, favorited post data, and all other social media related information is stored on your chosen home server. Different home servers have unique privacy policies and terms of service.
It is essential that you review the privacy policies and terms of service of the home server you've selected or registered an account with to understand how your information is handled.
SoraSNS and its developers cannot and do not access the data stored on your home server.

## Interests Predicted by the Application

The interests predicted by SoraSNS for personalization purposes are stored within the iCloud storage linked to your Apple ID. This data is private and the developers of SoraSNS cannot access it.
For detailed information on how Apple handles data stored in iCloud, please refer to Apple's privacy policy.

## Online AI features

If you choose to use online AI features (for example, reply summary or AI chat feature), the currently viewed post data, all public replies to that post, and your entered text to AI chat interface will be sent to one of our AI providers, including Google, OpenAI, or Perplexity. Please read their privacy policy on how they process and handle your requests.
Link safety check
By default, safe link checking is enabled to protect you from browsing malicious websites. You can disable link safety checking in app settings. We send the URL included in the post or the trending link carousel to Google Safe Link API to check for link safety. Your IP address is never exposed to Google as such requests are routed via Sora edge functions.

## Analytical Information

The app collects anonymous feature usage information to help the developer decide which feature to spend more time on development. Such information does not contain any of your personal information. After the server receives such submission, your IP is masked to the country level. This data is never used for purposes other than app development and functionalities. This data will never be used for advertisement or tracking. If you'd like, you can opt-out of this feature by going to your system settings app, find the app's individual settings page, and turn off feature usage reports.

## Your Choices and Control

Your privacy is crucial to us. If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy or the practices outlined here, please contact us at contact@smartsofuto.co.jp

We encourage all users to regularly review privacy policies of all platforms and services they use to stay informed about data practices.

## Updates to this Policy

From time to time, we may update our privacy policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted on this page, and users are encouraged to review our privacy policy periodically.

Thank you for using SoraSNS, and we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
