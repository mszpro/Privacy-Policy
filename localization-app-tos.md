These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are an agreement between you (“you” or “User”) and AsterKit Software Limited (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Local AI App Localization macOS application and related services (collectively, the “Service”).

This agreement is in addition to Apple’s Standard End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), which is accessible here:
[https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/)
If there is a conflict between these Terms and the Standard EULA, the Standard EULA will control to the extent required by Apple’s policies or applicable law.

BY DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SERVICE.

1. Scope of Service

Local AI App Localization provides tools for software localization workflows, including:
• Importing Xcode-exported localization packages (including .xcloc files) via drag-and-drop;
• Selecting a translation mode such as:
(a) on-device translation using Apple-provided system translation capabilities (where available); and/or
(b) online AI translation by connecting to a User-supplied, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint using a User-supplied URL and credential/token;
• Translating either (i) missing/untranslated strings only or (ii) all strings; and
• Exporting translated localization packages for re-import into Xcode or use in your development workflow.

The Service is a developer tool. It does not provide professional translation services and does not guarantee linguistic quality, completeness, or suitability for any particular market or purpose.

2. Eligibility

You must be able to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction to use the Service. If you are not of legal age, you may use the Service only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.

3. License to Use the App; Restrictions

3.1 The App and Our Materials

The Service (including the application software, UI, designs, logos, trademarks, documentation, and any Company-provided text or templates, if any) is owned by or licensed to the Company and is protected by intellectual property laws.

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal (or internal business), non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the Service on Apple-branded devices you own or control, solely in accordance with Apple’s Usage Rules and the Standard EULA.

3.2 You May NOT

Unless we explicitly allow it in writing, you may not (and may not enable others to):
• Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code from the Service, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law;
• Circumvent, disable, or interfere with security, licensing, or access controls;
• Use the Service to create, transmit, or store malware or to disrupt networks or services;
• Use the Service in a way that violates third-party rights or applicable laws; or
• Resell, rent, lease, sublicense, or make the Service available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time, except as permitted by Apple’s Usage Rules or applicable law.

4. User Content and Your Localization Data

4.1 Your Files and Text

You may upload or provide content to the Service, including .xcloc packages and the strings contained within them (collectively, “User Content”). You retain ownership of your User Content.

You represent and warrant that:
• You have all necessary rights to use, translate, and process the User Content (including any third-party text, trademarks, or copyrighted materials within it);
• Your User Content does not infringe or violate any third-party rights (including intellectual property, privacy, or contractual rights); and
• Your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

4.2 Local Processing

When you select on-device translation, translation may occur locally on your Mac using Apple-provided system capabilities. Availability may vary by macOS version, device capabilities, language pairs, and regional settings. We do not guarantee that on-device translation will be available for all languages or in all environments.

4.3 Online AI Translation; Third-Party Providers

When you select online AI translation, you may configure a third-party service by providing a URL/endpoint and credential/token (a “Third-Party AI Provider”). In that case:
• You authorize the Service to transmit your User Content (including text strings and associated context you provide) to your configured Third-Party AI Provider for the purpose of generating translations;
• You are solely responsible for your relationship with the Third-Party AI Provider, including fees, usage limits, content policies, data handling practices, security, and availability;
• The Company does not operate, control, or endorse any Third-Party AI Provider, even if the Service is compatible with that provider’s API format; and
• The Company is not responsible for any acts or omissions of Third-Party AI Providers, including outages, errors, policy enforcement, billing, privacy practices, security incidents, or data retention.

You are responsible for safeguarding your URL/endpoint and credentials/tokens. Do not share tokens publicly. If you believe your credentials are compromised, revoke and rotate them promptly.

5. AI Outputs; No Guarantee of Accuracy; Your Responsibility

AI-generated translations may be incorrect, incomplete, misleading, offensive, or otherwise unsuitable. The Service may also produce formatting, punctuation, placeholder, or parameter errors (including but not limited to issues involving variables, format specifiers, pluralization rules, or localization placeholders).

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:
• All translations are provided “as is” and may contain errors;
• You are solely responsible for reviewing, testing, validating, and approving any translations before use in production;
• You are solely responsible for ensuring translations comply with platform guidelines, legal requirements, and third-party rights; and
• The Company is not responsible for any damages, losses, claims, or liabilities arising from reliance on AI-generated translations.

6. Acceptable Use

You agree not to misuse the Service. This includes, without limitation:
• Attempting to access non-public areas or systems;
• Interfering with the Service’s operation, security, or other users’ enjoyment;
• Using the Service to process content you do not have rights to use or translate; or
• Using the Service in a way that violates third-party terms, including the terms of your chosen Third-Party AI Provider.

7. Purchases and Subscriptions (If Any)

If the Service offers paid features via in-app purchases or subscriptions:
• Payments are processed by Apple via the App Store;
• You manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings;
• Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period;
• We do not provide prorated refunds or credits for unused time, except where required by law; and
• Refunds (if any) are handled according to Apple’s App Store policies and processes.

8. Service Availability and Changes

We may modify, update, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time. We do not guarantee that any feature, translation mode, language pair, or integration will remain available. Online AI translation depends on third-party services and may be interrupted or unavailable.

9. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms, or if required for legal, security, or operational reasons.

Upon termination, the licenses granted to you under these Terms immediately end and you must stop using the Service.

10. Intellectual Property

Except for User Content, all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service (including all software, designs, trademarks, logos, and proprietary technology) are and remain the exclusive property of the Company and/or its licensors. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

11. Disclaimer of Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE, OR THAT ANY OUTPUT (INCLUDING TRANSLATIONS) WILL BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE.

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICE OR ANY OUTPUT, INCLUDING TRANSLATIONS OR THIRD-PARTY AI PROVIDER SERVICES.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.

13. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:
• Your use of the Service;
• Your violation of these Terms;
• Your violation of any law; or
• Your infringement of any third-party rights (including intellectual property rights in User Content) or breach of any third-party terms (including those of a Third-Party AI Provider).

14. Copyright Complaints

If you believe that the Service infringes your copyright, please contact us with sufficient information to identify the work and the allegedly infringing material, and your contact details.

15. Governing Law

To the extent not inconsistent with the Standard EULA or applicable consumer protection laws, these Terms are governed by the laws of Japan, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be brought in the courts having jurisdiction in Osaka, Japan, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

16. Changes to These Terms

Apple’s Standard End User License Agreement (EULA)

(Apple’s Standard EULA is accessible at [https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/) and may be updated by Apple. For convenience, the text below is included as provided in your template.)

Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.

a. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).

b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.

c. Termination. This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.

d. External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Services"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.

e. NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

f. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

g. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Licensed Application, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.

h. The Licensed Application and related documentation are "Commercial Items", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable.
