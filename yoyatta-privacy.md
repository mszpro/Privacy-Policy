## 1) Overview
This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, how long we keep it, and your choices. Yoyatta helps Hosts publish availability and lets Bookers reserve time and automatically create online meetings (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex).  
We do **not** access or store meeting audio, video, or chat content.

---

## 2) Scope
This Policy applies to:
- The **Yoyatta iOS app** and **App Clip**,
- **Booking pages** and related web experiences,
- Our APIs and notifications,
- Transactional communications we send (e.g., email).

---

## 3) Roles
- **Host:** creates and manages calendars.  
- **Booker:** reserves a time slot on a Host’s calendar.

---

## 4) Data We Collect

### 4.1 Information you provide
**Hosts**
- Email address, display name, profile image (or avatar you choose to provide),
- Calendar settings (e.g., name, description, rules),
- Integrations you connect (e.g., Zoom/Google/Teams/Webex),
- Optional destinations you connect for notifications (e.g., Slack webhook).

**Bookers**
- Email address (or a sign-in via Apple, Google, Microsoft, Slack, GitHub, LINE),
- Name and avatar if provided by you or your chosen sign-in provider,
- Selected time slot, timezone, and any note/title you add to a booking.

### 4.2 From services you connect (Hosts)
If you connect third-party services (e.g., Zoom/Google/Teams/Webex), we receive and store only the information needed to create/update/cancel meetings (such as meeting IDs and join links) and, where required, tokens to perform those actions on your behalf. We never access meeting content.

### 4.3 Collected automatically
- **Log data:** IP address, device/browser type, timestamps, and basic diagnostic information for security, fraud prevention, and reliability.  
- **Push delivery:** device push token (for Host notifications only).

### 4.4 Cookies & local storage (web)
- **Strictly necessary cookies** to operate booking pages and remember verified viewers,
- **First-party analytics cookies** to understand feature usage (see §6).  
We do **not** run third-party advertising cookies.

---

## 5) How We Use Data
- **Scheduling:** create, update, and cancel bookings; send calendar invitations and updates (.ics).  
- **Integrations:** create/update/delete meetings on your connected services when you ask us to.  
- **Security & abuse prevention:** protect accounts and calendars, detect fraud/spam, and enforce calendar rules.  
- **Communications & notifications:** send booking confirmations/updates/cancellations; deliver Host push notifications; post to connected channels (e.g., Slack) if you enable them.  
- **Product improvement & analytics:** understand which features are used and improve performance and reliability.  
- **Compliance:** comply with law, enforce our Terms, and protect rights and safety.

---

## 6) Analytics & Diagnostics

### 6.1 First-party analytics (internal platform)
We measure feature usage (e.g., “booking created,” “integration connected/failed”) to improve Yoyatta. We do not collect meeting content, and we do not use analytics for third-party ad targeting.

### 6.2 Error/crash monitoring (Sentry)
We use **Sentry** to capture app errors and crashes. To correlate events without directly identifying you, we may send a **hashed user ID**. Crash reports can include device/OS information and stack traces. This data is used solely to diagnose and fix issues.

---

## 7) Sharing & Service Providers
We do **not** sell personal data. We share personal data only with:
- **Cloud infrastructure and email delivery providers** (to host and send necessary communications),
- **Error/crash monitoring provider (Sentry)** as described in §6.2,
- **Third-party services you connect** (e.g., Zoom/Google/Teams/Webex, Slack) strictly to perform the actions you request.

We may disclose information to comply with legal obligations or to protect people, property, and our services.

---

## 8) Legal Bases (where applicable, e.g., EEA/UK)
- **Contract:** to provide the service you request,
- **Legitimate interests:** security, fraud prevention, reliability, and product improvement,
- **Consent:** where required (e.g., certain analytics/cookies or when connecting integrations),
- **Legal obligation:** compliance with law.

---

## 9) Data Retention
- **Bookings and related records:** kept as needed to provide the service and for legitimate business purposes (e.g., security, audit), then deleted or de-identified.  
- **Tokens for integrations:** kept only while a connection is active or until they expire/are revoked.  
- **Logs/diagnostics:** retained for a limited period and then deleted or aggregated.

---

## 10) Security
We use technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk to protect personal data in transit and at rest. No system is perfectly secure; please protect your devices and avoid reusing sensitive passwords as calendar passcodes.

---

## 11) International Transfers
We may process and store data in countries outside your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable law.

---

## 12) Your Choices
- **Disconnect integrations:** you can remove connected services at any time.  
- **Manage bookings:** cancel via the links we provide; we’ll send updated calendar invites.  
- **Diagnostics/analytics:** you may limit certain diagnostics in OS settings and contact us for additional options where feasible.  
- **Email preferences:** booking-related emails are necessary to operate Yoyatta; we don’t send marketing emails without consent.

---

## 13) Your Rights
Depending on your location (e.g., EEA/UK, Japan APPI, certain U.S. states), you may have rights to **access, correct, delete, export**, or **object to/restrict** certain processing.  
To exercise rights, email **contact@smartsofuto.co.jp**. We may need to verify your identity and identify the relevant booking(s) or account.

---

## 14) Notice to Invitees (Bookers who aren’t Yoyatta customers)
If you book time with a Yoyatta Host, we process your **email**, **selected time**, **timezone**, and share the **meeting join link** with you and the Host. We do not access meeting content. For data requests, email **contact@smartsofuto.co.jp** with the booking details (date/time and Host).

---

## 15) Children’s Privacy
Yoyatta is not directed to children. Do not use the service if you are under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction).

---

## 16) Changes
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will revise the “Last updated” date and, where required, provide notice in-app or by email. Your continued use means you accept the changes.
