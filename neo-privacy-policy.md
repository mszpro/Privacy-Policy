Privacy Policy
Last Updated: August 2, 2025

1. Introduction
Thank you for choosing our app. This policy explains the limited data handled by the application itself.

As a client for the Matrix network, your personal communications and account data are managed by the Matrix homeserver you choose to connect with. Each homeserver has its own privacy policy, and we strongly encourage you to read it.

2. The Role of Your Matrix Server
Our app is a client that connects you to the Matrix network. You choose which homeserver to register on or connect to. The privacy, security, and management of your primary data are governed entirely by the privacy policy of that server.

Data handled by your chosen homeserver includes, but is not limited to:

Your messages (including end-to-end encrypted content, which the server cannot read, and unencrypted content, which it can).

Files you send and receive.

Your profile information (e.g., display name, avatar).

Your list of contacts and joined rooms.

Your account credentials and login history.

We, the developers of this app, do not operate any homeservers and do not have access to any of this data. You are responsible for choosing a server that you trust.

3. Data Collected by the App Developer
We collect a minimal amount of data required for the app to function correctly and to improve your experience. This data is separate from your Matrix account data.

a. iCloud Data

To enable data synchronization across your devices, our app utilizes iCloud. All app-related data, such as local settings, is stored directly in your personal iCloud account. Your recovery key is encrypted with your device passcode or Face ID / Touch ID / Optic ID and stored in iCloud Keychain. This data is not accessible or readable by the developer. The management and security of your iCloud data are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy.

b. Crash Data

Our app collects crash data through Apple’s built-in infrastructure to help us identify and fix bugs. Please refer to Apple’s Privacy Policy for more details on how they handle this data:
Apple Privacy Policy

c. Anonymous Analytics Data

We collect anonymous analytics about how you use the app. This includes which features are used and how frequently they are accessed.

Data Protection Measures:

No personal information from your Matrix account is collected.

Your IP address is masked and processed only at the country level, preventing any direct personal identification.

4. Usage of Collected Data
We use the limited data we collect strictly for:

Improving app performance and fixing bugs based on crash reports.

Understanding which features are most valuable to our users, which helps us prioritize future development and enhancements.

5. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to outside parties. As stated above, we do not have access to your personal chat data or account information from your Matrix server.

The anonymous analytics data we collect is stored securely and may be processed by third-party analytic tools that adhere to strict privacy standards.

6. Data Retention
We retain collected crash and analytics data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. This data may be maintained indefinitely in an aggregated, anonymous form for statistical purposes.

7. Children’s Privacy
Our app is not designed to knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. The age requirement for using the Matrix network may be different and is determined by the policy of your chosen homeserver. If you believe we might have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy within the app or on our website. Your continued use of the app after changes have been posted will constitute your acceptance of the updated policy.
